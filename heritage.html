                    Daringbadi, often called the ‚ÄúKashmir of Odisha,‚Äù is a hill station surrounded by pine forests,
                    coffee and pepper plantations, and valleys with waterfalls and rivers. Its cool climate, misty
                    hills, and occasional winter snowfall make it unique in Odisha.

                <p>
                    In the times before British rule, Daringbadi and its surrounding areas were under the sway of tribal
                    chieftains who governed the local clans, particularly the Kondh and Kutia Kondh. These leaders
                    followed customary laws and traditions, and their authority was based on lineage, wisdom, and
                    respect for nature. Over time, with the arrival of colonial administrators, the region‚Äôs name
                    ‚ÄúDaringbadi‚Äù is said to have come from a British officer named Daring, combined with ‚Äòbadi‚Äô, meaning
                    settlement or village in the local dialect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tribal heritage runs deep in rituals, folklore, and governance even today. Kings and chiefs were
                    not merely rulers ‚Äî they were custodians of land, forests, and community welfare. Many of the older
                    folk still recount stories of how decisions were made under ancient trees, how festivals honored
                    nature and ancestors, and how social harmony was maintained without modern enforcement. These
                    cultural memories form an essential bridge between past and present for the people of Daringbadi.
